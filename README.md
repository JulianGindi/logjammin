## Functionality

### Todos

`todo` - lists all todos (now and later)
`todo [now|later]` - lists todos for now OR later
`todo [now|later] <todo>` - adds new todo to either list
`todo done <text>` - removes todo with specified text
`todo [now|later] edit` - opens either list in vim

### Notes

`note` - lists all notes
`note <note_name>` - opens specified note in vim (with autocomplete, and "fuzzy" matching)
`note <new_name>` - creates a new note and opens vim
`note peak <note_name>` - shows the first few lines of a given note

### Set-up
